coordinate systems
==================

Fairly arbitrarily, we decide that -Z shall be north.
Positive X is east.
Positive Y is up.

This is as described in the "Right-handed system" note in
https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems .
It also matches the rough analog of "user"/"screen" space as common in computing
(and also matches the feelings of minecraft, coincidentally).
